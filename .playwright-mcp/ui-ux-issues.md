# UI/UX Issues - CloutAgent Workflow Builder

**Testing Date:** 2025-10-14
**Browser:** Chromium (Playwright)
**Screen Size:** Default (1280x720)

## Critical Issues

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED - APPLICATION CRASH - Property Panel Cannot Open
**Severity:** CRITICAL - BLOCKS ALL FUNCTIONALITY
**Location:** AgentProperties component
**Issue:** Application completely crashed when clicking on any agent node to open the property panel.

**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ
**Fix Applied:** Changed `usePropertyForm.ts` to use inline config extraction instead of calling `useNodeConfig` hook inside `useEffect`

---

### 2. Toolbar Layout - Controls Overlapping
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Top navigation bar
**Issue:** The workflow controls (Run Workflow, Save, Reset View, History, Clear Canvas) are positioned in the center of the navbar, but this creates overlap/collision issues with the project name on the right and back button on the left.

**Current State:**
- Controls rendered via portal to `#workflow-toolbar` div
- Centered positioning causes layout issues
- No responsive behavior defined

**Expected:** Controls should have proper spacing and responsive layout that doesn't overlap with other navbar elements

---

### 2. Node Has Configuration Errors on Load
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Default agent node on canvas
**Issue:** The pre-loaded agent node shows 2 errors and 1 warning:
- "Agent node must have a model configured"
- "Agent node must have a system prompt"
- "Consider adding subagents for parallel task execution"

**Current State:**
- Node shows "Claude Agent" with "Sonnet 4.5" but validation says model not configured
- System prompt is empty

**Expected:** Default node should either:
1. Have valid defaults that pass validation, OR
2. Not show validation errors until user attempts to run

---

## High Priority Issues

### 3. Validation Panel Always Visible
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Right panel
**Issue:** The validation panel with errors/warnings is always visible and takes up significant screen space, even for minor issues.

**Expected:**
- Panel should be collapsible
- Could be minimized to just an icon/badge showing count
- Should not block workflow building for non-critical warnings

---

### 4. Missing Theme Toggle Visibility
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Top navigation bar
**Issue:** The theme toggle button shows "Switch to dark mode" but the icon/visual state is not clear in light mode.

**Expected:** Better visual indicator of current theme and toggle state

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 5. No Visual Feedback for Drag and Drop
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Node Palette
**Issue:** Instructions say "Drag to canvas or click to add" but there's no visual feedback when starting to drag a component.

**Expected:**
- Cursor should change when hovering over draggable items
- Visual feedback during drag operation
- Drop zone indicators on canvas

---

### 6. Canvas Empty State After Adding Node
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Canvas
**Issue:** After the default node is added, there's no guidance on next steps or how to connect nodes.

**Expected:** Show contextual help or tooltips for first-time users

---

## Testing Notes

### Observations from Initial Load:
1. ‚úÖ Light mode renders correctly
2. ‚úÖ Default agent node appears on canvas
3. ‚úÖ Node Palette is visible and organized
4. ‚úÖ Test Mode toggle is visible
5. ‚úÖ Workflow estimate shows in bottom-left
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation errors appear immediately
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è No clear workflow to resolve validation errors

---

---

### 7. Property Panel - Model Already Selected But Shows Error
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Agent property panel validation
**Issue:** The node shows "Sonnet 4.5" on canvas and "Claude Sonnet 4.5" is selected in the dropdown, but validation still says "Agent node must have a model configured"

**Current State:**
- Model dropdown shows "Claude Sonnet 4.5" selected
- Node displays "Sonnet 4.5"
- Validation panel shows error: "Agent node must have a model configured"

**Expected:** If model is selected, validation should pass

---

### 8. Property Panel - Wide Panel Reduces Canvas Space
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Right-side property panel
**Issue:** The property panel is very wide (~400-500px), reducing usable canvas space significantly.

**Observations:**
- Panel contains: header, duplicate/delete buttons, 5 sections (Basic Info, System Prompt, Advanced, Tools, Cost estimate)
- Panel is not resizable
- No collapse/expand functionality
- Takes up ~30-40% of screen width

**Expected:**
- Panel should be resizable
- Should have collapse/minimize button
- Could use tabs or accordion to reduce vertical space

---

### 9. No Visual Connection Between Validation and Property Panel
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Validation panel + Property panel
**Issue:** When viewing a validation error, it's not clear which field needs to be fixed in the property panel.

**Expected:**
- Clicking "View node" in validation error should highlight the problematic field
- Could scroll to and flash the relevant section
- Field with error could have red border or icon

---

### 10. System Prompt Validation Inconsistent
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Agent configuration
**Issue:** Validation requires system prompt but many use cases don't need one (agents can work with just model and tools).

**Expected:**
- System prompt should be optional, not required
- Or provide better default system prompts
- Warning instead of error for missing system prompt

---

## Property Panel UI/UX Observations

### Positive Elements:
1. ‚úÖ Clean, organized layout with clear sections
2. ‚úÖ Good use of headings and descriptions
3. ‚úÖ Helpful tooltips/hints below fields
4. ‚úÖ Auto-save indicator visible
5. ‚úÖ Cost estimate shown at bottom

### Issues Identified:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Too wide, reduces canvas space
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Not resizable
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No minimize/collapse button
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Long scroll for all fields
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è No keyboard shortcuts visible
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate/Delete buttons could be in overflow menu

## Responsive Design Issues

### 11. üî¥ Mobile (375px) - Completely Broken Layout
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Device:** iPhone SE / Small mobile (375x667)
**Issue:** Application is completely unusable on mobile devices

**Problems Identified:**
1. **Property Panel Fullscreen**: Takes entire screen, no way to see canvas
2. **Toolbar Overflow**: All buttons stack and overlap in navbar
3. **Node Palette**: Left sidebar also takes full width
4. **Canvas Not Visible**: With sidebars open, canvas is completely hidden
5. **No Mobile Navigation**: No hamburger menu or mobile-optimized layout
6. **Controls Too Small**: Buttons and text too small to tap easily
7. **Validation Panel**: Takes up bottom of screen, blocking content

**Impact:** Application cannot be used on mobile devices at all

**Expected:**
- Responsive layout with collapsible sidebars
- Mobile-optimized navigation (hamburger menu)
- Full-screen property panel on mobile with back button
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44x44px)
- Bottom sheet or drawer pattern for properties
- Hide validation panel by default on mobile

---

### 12. üî¥ API Rate Limiting Error - Dry Run Endpoint
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** Backend API `/api/dry-run`
**Issue:** Massive number of 429 errors from dry-run endpoint

**Error Pattern:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 429 (Too Many Requests)
Dry run failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'T', "Too many r"... is not valid JSON
```

**Observed Behavior:**
- 60+ consecutive 429 errors in ~2 seconds
- Happens when property panel closes or node updates
- Frontend making excessive API calls
- No exponential backoff or rate limit handling

**Root Causes:**
1. Auto-save triggering on every keystroke (debounce not working?)
2. Validation running on every render
3. No request deduplication
4. Backend has rate limit but frontend doesn't respect it

**Fix Required:**
- Implement proper request debouncing (500-1000ms)
- Add request deduplication/cancellation
- Implement exponential backoff
- Show user-friendly rate limit message
- Consider reducing validation frequency

---

### 13. ‚úÖ Model Validation Fixed
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Note:** The "Agent node must have a model configured" error is now resolved after closing and reopening the panel. Model validation is working correctly.

## Next: Test Responsive Design

Will test tablet and larger desktop sizes to identify responsive design issues.
