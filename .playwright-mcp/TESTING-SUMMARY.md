# UI/UX Testing Summary Report

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Tester**: Playwright MCP Automation
**Duration**: ~15 minutes comprehensive testing
**Frontend**: http://localhost:3002
**Backend**: http://localhost:3001

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive UI/UX testing across multiple screen sizes (mobile 375x667, tablet 768x1024, desktop 1920x1080) revealed **9 issues** with **1 CRITICAL blocker** preventing workflow execution.

### Critical Findings
- **Workflow execution completely broken** due to circular JSON serialization error
- Validation errors do not prevent execution attempts
- Mobile responsive design needs significant work

### Positive Findings
- Dark/Light mode works perfectly
- Node configuration UI is comprehensive and well-designed
- Drag-and-drop connections work smoothly
- Real-time cost estimation is excellent

## Issues by Severity

### CRITICAL (1)
- **#8**: Workflow execution fails with "Converting circular structure to JSON" error

### HIGH (3)
- **#1**: Mobile layout cramped and potentially overlapping
- **#3**: Mobile canvas UI with overlapping controls
- **#9**: "Run Workflow" button not disabled despite validation errors

### MEDIUM (4)
- **#2**: New projects created with validation errors
- **#4**: Real-time validation doesn't update immediately
- **#5**: Model selection validation inconsistent
- **#7**: Nodes added without automatic connection

### LOW (1)
- **#6**: No visual feedback when adding nodes

## Recommended Fix Order

1. **IMMEDIATE** - Fix circular JSON error in workflow execution (BLOCKER)
2. **IMMEDIATE** - Disable Run button when validation errors exist
3. **HIGH** - Fix default project creation to avoid initial errors
4. **HIGH** - Fix real-time validation updates
5. **MEDIUM** - Improve mobile responsive layouts
6. **NICE** - Auto-connect newly added nodes
7. **NICE** - Add visual feedback for node additions

## Testing Coverage Completed

✅ Multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
✅ Flow configuration and node properties
✅ Input/output configuration mechanisms
✅ Workflow execution attempts
✅ Navigation flows
✅ Form validation display
✅ Dark/Light mode switching
✅ Variables panel
✅ Component sidebar
✅ Canvas interactions (zoom, pan, drag-drop)

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize issues with development team
2. Fix critical execution blocker immediately
3. Implement validation blocking before next deployment
4. Plan mobile responsive design improvements
5. Consider user onboarding flow to prevent validation errors
