## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Send a private report

Send details to: **[security@yourdomain.com]** (replace with actual contact)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Possible impact and attack scenarios
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use `npm audit` or `uv audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Review security advisories before adding new dependencies

2. **Code Security**
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use secure session management
   - Apply principle of least privilege
   - Implement proper access controls

### For Users

1. **Environment Security**
   - Keep your `.env` files secure and never commit them
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication where possible
   - Keep your dependencies updated

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper error handling (don't expose sensitive info)
   - Use security headers
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Regular security audits

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report received** - We confirm receipt and begin investigation
2. **Initial assessment** - We assess the severity and impact
3. **Fix development** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated disclosure** - We work with you on disclosure timing
5. **Release** - We release the fix and security advisory
6. **Public disclosure** - We publicly acknowledge the vulnerability and fix

## Security Tools

This project uses several security tools:

### Static Analysis
- **ESLint** - JavaScript/TypeScript security rules
- **Ruff** - Python security linting
- **Bandit** (optional) - Python security scanner

### Dependency Scanning
- **npm audit** - Node.js dependency vulnerabilities
- **Safety** (optional) - Python dependency vulnerabilities

### Runtime Security
- **Helmet.js** (for Express apps) - Security headers
- **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing protection
- **Rate limiting** - Protection against abuse

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

### Input Validation
```python
# Bad
user_input = request.get('data')
exec(user_input)  # Never do this!

# Good
user_input = request.get('data')
if validate_input(user_input):
    process_safe_input(user_input)
```

### SQL Injection
```python
# Bad
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Good
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### XSS Prevention
```javascript
// Bad
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// Good
element.textContent = userInput;
// or use a sanitization library
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Bad - in committed code
API_KEY = "sk-abc123..."

# Good - in .env file (not committed)
API_KEY = sk-abc123...
```
