**Gap Description:**
- **Flowise:** 100+ LLM integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, Hugging Face, local models)
- **CloutAgent:** Claude only (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)

**User Impact:**
- Users locked into Claude ecosystem only
- Cannot compare models or use specialized LLMs
- Limits use cases (e.g., local/privacy-focused deployments)
- Reduces addressable market significantly

**User Demand:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very High)
- Flowise users frequently mention "flexible LLM choice" as key strength
- Multi-model support is table stakes for workflow builders
- Users want to experiment and compare models

**Implementation Complexity:** 🔴 High (8-12 weeks)
- Abstract Claude SDK calls into generic LLM interface
- Implement provider adapters (OpenAI, Google, Cohere, Ollama)
- Add model selection UI with provider-specific parameters
- Update cost calculation for different pricing models
- Test streaming and tool calling across providers

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- **Phase 1:** OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) - most requested (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Google (Gemini), Cohere, Azure OpenAI (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** Local LLMs (Ollama, LocalAI) for privacy use cases (4 weeks)

**Risks:**
- Deviates from "Claude-focused" positioning
- Increases maintenance burden
- Quality may vary across providers

**Mitigation:**
- Market as "Claude-first, multi-LLM capable"
