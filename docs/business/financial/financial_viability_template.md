## Key Research Areas

### 1. Unit Economics Analysis
- **Revenue per unit**: Average revenue generated per customer, transaction, or product
- **Cost per unit**: Direct costs associated with serving each customer or delivering each product
- **Gross margin**: Revenue minus direct costs, expressed as percentage
- **Contribution margin**: Revenue minus variable costs per unit

- **Payback period**: Time required to recover customer acquisition investment

### 2. Pricing Strategy Validation
- **Value-based pricing**: Pricing based on customer perceived value and willingness to pay
- **Competitive pricing**: Market positioning relative to competitors
- **Cost-plus pricing**: Pricing based on cost structure plus desired margin
- **Price sensitivity analysis**: Customer response to different price points
- **Pricing model optimization**: One-time, subscription, usage-based, or hybrid models
- **Price elasticity**: Revenue impact of price changes

### 3. Cost Structure Optimization
- **Fixed costs**: Rent, salaries, insurance, equipment that don't vary with volume
- **Variable costs**: Materials, transaction fees, commissions that scale with volume
- **Semi-variable costs**: Costs that have fixed and variable components
- **Operational leverage**: How cost structure affects profitability as revenue scales
- **Cost reduction opportunities**: Areas for efficiency improvement and cost savings
- **Break-even analysis**: Volume required to cover all costs

### 4. Revenue Projections and Scenarios
- **Bottom-up forecasting**: Building projections from customer, product, and market data
